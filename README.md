# Real Estate Schmitt AG


## Introduction

You have found a job as a data engineer at the Schmitt AG conglomerate and are employed in the internal IT consulting department. Due to the Covid-19 situation, the company is economically burdened and would now also like to invest in other business models.

Due to the ongoing real estate boom, a 'Real Estate' department with around 16 employees has been under construction for several months. Real estate objects are brokered. The Real Estate department then has the role of a broker/broker. Operations have already started successfully. However, an integrated IT system does not yet exist. And this is where you come in when it comes to data engineering topics.

You should carry out the following steps together with the Real Estate department:
1. Create a complete entity relationship model (based on P.Chen, 1976) including documentation.
2. Converted the entity relationship model into a database including documentation. 
3. The Real Estate department is also interested in business intelligence topics. Specifically, it is about a data warehouse. What architecture and scheme do you recommend? Why? Create a corresponding data model. 
4. High data quality is very important in this project. Create an initial concept of how data can be continuously integrated or how existing legacy data can be migrated to the new IT system and the data quality can reach a >97% level.
5. A presentation (Powerpoint) must be created for the project results and presented to the customer.
